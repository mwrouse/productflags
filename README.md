# Product Flags Module
ThirtyBees Module for adding flags to products.


## What is a product flag?
A product flag is something you need to call attention to on your product.

Does it require something specific? Special shipping?

Anything you need to call attention to on the product page near the product price.


## Hook
This uses a custom hook called `displayProductFlags`. You can add it to your theme with `{hook h='displayProductFlags' product=$product}`.
